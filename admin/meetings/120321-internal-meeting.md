### Agenda

- What next week will look like
- Asking Hema for a last meeting
- Repo organization
- Search this vs apply in filter sidebar

### Decisions Made and Their Reasoning

- Repo organization

  - Put all source code in src folder

- Filter sidebar

  - Apply button since we already have it working
  - Should it be displayed on recipe and favorites page
    - Solution: hide filter sidebar on recipe and favorites page
  - Remove from home page too, and only be applyed on the search page
  - Get rid of search this button, so only apply works on search page

- Fix mobile versions

  - Ingredient/equipment card list
    - Change to scroll bar on mobile version but keep desktop version
  - Home page: dropdown

- Only delete and copy in the favorites, no more moving since copy overlaps

- Can't store objects in local storage

- Adding key binds (look at project board for a description of which keys to use)

### Ideas for Further Investigation

- "don't show again" for confirm popup when trying to unheart a recipe

### When the meeting finished

2:45 PM
