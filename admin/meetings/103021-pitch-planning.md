Jump to ingredients, recipe, tools

* Have buttons on page

Popular recipes

Display favorites recipes 

* Favorites list has all recipes
* User name lists are subsets of favorites list

Coding style: find a standard style on the internet for everyone to follow

* Commenting style / documentation style bring up in TA meeting

Tasks:

* Assign tasks on slack or konbon in miro
