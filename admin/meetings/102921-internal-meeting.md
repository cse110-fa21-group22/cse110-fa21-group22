### Decisions Made and Their Reasoning

- Our minimum viable product will be a cross-platform recipe browsing/searching app featuring...
  - Searching and exploring recipes
  - Cross platform support (pc/phone/tablet)
  - Favorites list (meets CRUD requirement)
- We decided we would stick with local storage until we built out more features to target our audience
- If we have time (i.e. "extension"), we will...
  - Add editing recipes and local storage
  - Create a shopping list feature
  - Highlight the current step by clicking on it
    - "Go to steps" takes you to the highlighted step
- We decided on four pages
  - Homepage
  - Search results
  - Favorites
  - Recipe
- Our nav bar will have three buttons
  - Home
  - Search
  - Favorites
- Until next meeting we will be working on the following
  - Wireframe - Mitchell and Elliot
  - UML - Emily, Egor
  - Interface - Justin, Samantha
- Emily will send out a when2meet to find a meeting time
  - Everyone is expected to finish their tasks by Sunday night

### Ideas for Further Investigation

- What should we feature within each recipe?
  - e.g. prep time

### When the meeting finished

- 3:00pm end time
