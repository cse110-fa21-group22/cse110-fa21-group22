### Decisions Made and Their Reasoning

For PR requests, there is now a PR template. The process for submitting a PR will be as follows:
- Fill out the template 
- Fix linting and code factors errors
- Assign a reviewer 
- Reviewer pulls branch and checks changes + that code still works in the live server
- Merge branch

Worked on MVP for the rest of the meeting
