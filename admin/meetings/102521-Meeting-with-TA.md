 ### Decisions Made and Their Reasoning
 Mitchell will be in charge of looking over Miro board in general. 
 
 This week we need to do brainstorming artifacts / project pitch. 
 
 **Project pitch is due Monday.**
 After the pitch, then we can start developing the code.
 We can also do pitch on a Sunday or Saturday if we want, just need to let Hema know. 
 Pitch is just giving information about product, not exactly selling the product
 
 Read  Shape Up --> Read from pg 57

 Parts of the Pitch: 
 * Problem 
 * Proposed Solution 
 * Users 
 * Road Blocks
 * Rabbit holes
 * Wire frame (where is the search bar, page by page block diagram, what info in which part, use figma for wireframes )
 
 In general, use miro for everything but wireframes and uml diagrams.
 
 **Brainstorming artifacts due by the end of the week**
Needs to be neat and creative

User persona (4-5)

User stories helps get to app features (different scenarios and how the app will help)

 List of features 
 * Skills: add something related to cooking 
 * Favorite recipes
 * help poor eye sight 
 * Filter by quickness
 Project Roadmap (what are you going to do, which features are you going to do in which week)
 Wireframe (helps translate design into html)
 
Problem Formalizations 
 * Groceries feature
UML diagram (identify different components in application and tell how they interact with each other, can help modularize code)
 
 **App Design/CRUD operations**
 Focus on searching for recipes first before having users enter their own recipe
 * Create a shopping list or favorite list instead of create a recipe
 * Read: search functionality 
 * Update: modify recipe, local copy of it
 * Delete: deleting recipes from their favorite list, delete modifications to recipe, delete the recipes that the user is not interested in 
 
 Letting users create recipes adds complexity because recipes needs to be shared with other users
 
 Where will data be stored: Local storage best for minimum viable product
 
 Users will only be interested into their own favorite list, etc -> local storage make more sense in this situation 
 * Browsers have local storage 
 * Consider storing google drive 
 
 Final Product will be posted to Github Pages. 
 
 ### Ideas for Further Investigation
 What makes our application *better* than existing applications?
 
 How is it beginner friendly? What features support this? 
 
 ### When the meeting finished
