### Agenda

- New Business
  - demo current product
  - get advice from Hema

### Suggestions:

#### Recipe Page:

- make everything bigger
- cards have horizontal line and vertical lines, we do not want to confuse the user
- we could have a share button on the page
- mobile sharing can be clunky
-

#### Favorite Page:

- could have import and exports for user syncing.

### Clarfication for future design

- tags for filtering
  - when tags are clicked, it will modify the current displaying result, if there is no searching result currently being diplayed, it will filter user's search query.
