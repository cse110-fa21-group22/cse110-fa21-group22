### Agenda

- Unresolved business
  - Meeting was impromptu, no unresolved business
- New Business
  - Categories sidebar needed work
  - Recipe page needed to be built
  - GitHub Actions is confusing and we are unsure if its required
- Items on the agenda that are not discussed

### Decisions Made and Their Reasoning

- We decided we would start without an SPA, but we would ask Hema about it
  - If she says we should, we will proceed with an SPA
- We decided we would have the categories sidebar visibility "toggleable"
  - We added a "three bars" icon to the nav bar to handle this toggle
  - Sidebar will only be visible by default on the search page
- The sidebar will filter everything in the app immediately (i.e. present and future search results, explore)

### Ideas for Further Investigation

- Sidebar categories need further investigation
- David and Emily are investigating GitHub actions

### When the meeting finished

Meeting finished at 3:00pm

### To Do

- David and Emily will ask Hema if GitHub actions is required
- Mitchell and Egor will build out categories sidebar on all pages
