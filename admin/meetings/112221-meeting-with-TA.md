### Ideas for Further Investigation

- Move button didn't work in Demo
- Hema's review of our app
  - She liked our apps appearance and basic functionality
  - Restricting scrolling on homepage because we have a refresh button
    - Meaning of "refresh" is confusing
  - Maybe exclude recipes without pictures?
  - Recipe cards on homepage getting cut off and required scrolling
    - Recipe cards need to be resized for screen size
  - Adding to favorites, she didn't know how to just "favorite" without a list
    - Maybe add "Favorites" thats always checked
  - Style checkboxes and text in dropdown menu
  - Removing from favorites list will remove from master favorites list but no other lists?
  - Names of long ingredients are being cut off (consider wrapping text)
  - Ingredients should be clearer about what quantities are associated with what
- For the sidebar categories, consider the following
  - Prep time
  - Type of meal (dessert, lunch, breakfast)
- User category filters but no search text?
- Highlight current step keybinds
