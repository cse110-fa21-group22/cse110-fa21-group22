### Decisions made and their reasoning:

    - Help those who need help and get help when needed
    - Conflict resolution: First talk to the person of conflict. If it escalates then talk to Dennis or Emily (Team leads)
    - Vote on ideas (full Democracy)
    - If there are any difficulties, speak to our TA
        - We can also brainstorm and work with TA
        - TA is meant to guide and mentor us
Ideas for Further Investigation:
  - What is the purpose of leads?
    - Organize meetings and make sure things are going smoothly
    - Oversee progress
- Talked more about the project and whats to come
    - CRUD application
    - User email, password, database, etc
    - Users should be able to find different recipes, delete, read, update, etc.
- We will need to come together and talk about what we want this app has and needs
    - Databases, APIs, etc
- What kind of app are we designing? For profit? This would require premium, ads, etc.
- Recommendations:
    - Focus on what is important first. Then start adding more features.
    - Look at other recipe apps and sites
        - See whats missing, whats good, whats bad, etc.
        - Draw inspiration from the app
- Responsibilities:
    - Designers:
        - Come up with a structure and how the front end will work
        - What will the end users want to see
        - What and where are the features that will be in place for the project
        - Layouts, diagrams, etc.
        - They finalize the design
        - After they finish designing they will also work on the project along with everyone else. ie. front-end, back-end
