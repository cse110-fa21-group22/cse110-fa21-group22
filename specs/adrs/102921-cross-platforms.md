Technical Story: deciding on if users can use web app across different platforms, for example, laptop, phone, tablet.

## Context and Problem Statement
    When users are cooking or researching, they might have different preferences of what type of device they like to use.
    For example, one user likes using their phone because it's small and easy for them, but another user likes using their 
    laptop because it is bigger and more comfortable for their eyes, and another user who likes using their tablet because 
    they want a bigger screen than a phone and their kitchen doesn't have enough space for a laptop.
    
## Considered Options
1. Compatiable for all devices by using css
2. Only making it suitable for laptop

## Decision Outcome
Choose option 1; 
- option 2 wouldn't be user friendly because users have different preferences
- option 1 would target a bigger range of users and wouldn't be hard to add to css

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
- compatiable across different platforms
