Technical Story: Deciding on whether to have one HTML file (Single page application - lab 7) or one for each webpage. 

## Context and Problem Statement
    A SPA wouldn't have load each webpage. We can't decide on SPA or having individual HTML files for each webpage we want.

## Considered Options
1. One HTML file
2. One HTML file per webpage

## Decision Outcome
Choose option 2; 
- option 1 would need more time since we need to put the individual files into one and organize the file; 
- option 2 we thought lab 7 wanted to do SPA, but after talking to Hema, it isn't necessary; 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
We already have option 2 done or nearly completed.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
May not be as fast compared to if it was a SPA but we aren't loading a lot of information.
