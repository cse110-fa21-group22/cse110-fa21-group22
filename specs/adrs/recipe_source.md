Technical Story: deciding where the source of recipe should come from. 

## Context and Problem Statement
    The recipes web-app must have content of recipes, therefore, we have to decide where we want get recipe. 

## Considered Options
1. Get receipe from people, we input recipes ourselves. 
2. Using web-scrapper to get receipes from other websites. 
3. Using API to get receipe. 

## Decision Outcome
Choose option 3; 
option 1 is too much work; 
option 3 is too complicated; 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
getting recipes from API is easy and fast

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
Have to work around with API; <p>
It may not have all the features, tages we are looking for.
