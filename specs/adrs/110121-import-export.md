Technical Story: Deciding how a user would be able to share recipes, for example, share from laptop to phone. 

## Context and Problem Statement
    We don't have a login and are using local storage to save the user's favorites. 
    If the user found the recipe on their laptop but later wants to use their phone, they need an easy way to pull it up.

## Considered Options
1. Login and using cloud to save data
2. Import/Export files
3. Using Google/Apple to save data

## Decision Outcome
Choose option 3; 
option 1 is too much work and we have limited time; 
option 3 is too complicated; 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
importing and exporting recipes will be the fastest and do-able during for this time frame

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
Would be easier for users if we did option 1 or 3
