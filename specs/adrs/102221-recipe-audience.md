## Context and Problem Statement

there must be a targetted audience for recipes, and our recipes is going to focus on this specific audiences.

## Decision Outcome

Since we are all college students, and we all share the fact that we do not have enough time, not really familiar to cook for ourselves. <p>
therefore, our targeted audience will be similar people as ourselves who are busy and first-timer at cooking which is specific enough to describe the profile of our audience and wide enough to cover a lot of people
