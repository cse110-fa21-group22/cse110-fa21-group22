Technical Story: deciding selling point of our app - easy scrolling

## Context and Problem Statement
    When users are cooking, their hands are probably dirty and touching their phone/tablet/laptop isn't ideal.
    Thus, the users need a simple way of getting to the next steps or seeing the ingredients without getting the
    whole screen or mouse dirty, which would lead them to not being able to see.

## Considered Options
1. Speech to text 
2. Like Siri/Echo/etc. listening to the users commands to go next/back/ingredients/steps/equipment
3. Timer to go to next step
4. One button to go to next step/ingredients and highlighting current step

## Decision Outcome
Choose option 4 
- option 1 wouldn't be too much work because it is similar to a lab, but would still require another method to go to next step or ingredients
- option 2 is too complicated
- option 3 wouldn't work because you would need to set the timer and it can't be preset because people take diifferent lengths of time to complete a step
- option 4 would still require touching the screen but it would be one touch -- simple button to go to next step which would highlight for better readibility 
and remember the step in case the user uses the one touch button to go to the ingredients

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
- Big button to go to next step or ingredients
- would remember the current step and highlight it
- easier to read for users
- can go back to ingredients easily

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
Would still have to touch screen and get a spot or two messy
